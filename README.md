- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m King Tony
- I am a very desparate developer who never stop exploring new project ideas. I often find it difficult to quit, no matter how tough the challenge is.
- I certainly do not like the fact that I have not worked on a paid project, so sad. But anyway, if you've got a job for me I will be glad to take it.
